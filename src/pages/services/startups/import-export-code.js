        Import Export Code, also known as IEC, is a ten-digit alphanumeric code
        issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), an authority
        under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in India. This unique code
        acts as an identification number for individuals and businesses involved
        in cross-border trade operations.
