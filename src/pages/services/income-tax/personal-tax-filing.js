      <h3>
        Step 1: Registration and Obtaining a Permanent Account Number (PAN)
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you haven't already, ensure that you have a valid Permanent Account
        Number (PAN) issued by the Income Tax Department. It serves as a unique
        identification number for all your income tax-related activities. In
        case you don't have a PAN, apply for one through the online portal of
        the Income Tax Department.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2: Gather the Necessary Documents</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned earlier, collect all the required documents such as PAN
        card, Aadhaar card, Form 16, investment proofs, and other relevant
        financial records. Make sure these documents are accurate and up to
        date.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 3: Determine the Appropriate Income Tax Return (ITR) Form</h3>
      <p>
        Identify the correct ITR form based on your income sources, residential
        status, and other applicable factors. This will ensure that you provide
        accurate information and comply with the filing requirements.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 4: Calculate Your Total Income and Tax Liability</h3>
      <p>
        Calculate your total income from various sources, including salary,
        house property, capital gains, and business or profession. Consider the
        deductions available under the Income Tax Act to arrive at the taxable
        income and compute your tax liability accordingly.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 5: Fill Out the Income Tax Return Form</h3>
      <p>
        Carefully fill out the selected ITR form, providing accurate details of
        your income, deductions, and taxes paid. Ensure that you double-check
        the information before moving on to the next step.
      </p>
      <h3>Step 6: Verify and Submit Your Income Tax Return</h3>
      <p>
        Review the filled-out income tax return form for any errors or
        discrepancies. Once you are satisfied with the accuracy of the
        information provided, verify the form electronically using your Aadhaar
        card, net banking, or other available methods. After verification,
        submit the form to the Income Tax Department either online or through
        physical submission, as per the prescribed procedure.
      </p>
      <h2>6. Important Deadlines and Penalties</h2>
      <p>
        To avoid penalties and legal complications, it is crucial to adhere to
        the prescribed deadlines for income tax filing in India. The due dates
        for filing income tax returns vary depending on the category of taxpayer
        and the nature of income. Failure to file the return within the
        specified timeline may attract penalties and interest charges as per the
        Income Tax Act.
      </p>

        While filing your income tax returns, it is important to be cautious and
        avoid common mistakes that could lead to unnecessary hassles or delays.
