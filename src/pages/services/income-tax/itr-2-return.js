      <p>
        ITR 2 form is primarily designed for individuals and Hindu Undivided
        Families (HUFs) who do not have income from business or profession. It
        is applicable to individuals who have income from salary, house
        property, capital gains, or other sources, excluding business or
        profession income. If you are a salaried individual, a freelancer, or an
        investor in the stock market, this form is likely to be relevant to you.
      </p>
      <h2>Understanding the Purpose of ITR 2 Form</h2>
      <p>
        The primary purpose of filing the ITR 2 form is to provide a
        comprehensive overview of an individual's income and tax liabilities for
        a given financial year. By filling out this form accurately, taxpayers
        can ensure that they have fulfilled their obligations and disclosed
        their income from various sources.
      </p>
      <h2>Eligibility Criteria for Filing ITR 2 Form</h2>
      <p>
        To determine whether you are eligible to file the ITR 2 form, you need
        to assess the sources of your income. The following individuals or HUFs
        are eligible to file ITR 2 form:
