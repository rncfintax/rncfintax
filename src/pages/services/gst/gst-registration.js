      <h3>1. What is GST?</h3>
      <p>
        Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an indirect tax levied on the supply of
        goods and services in India. Introduced on July 1, 2017, GST has
        revolutionized the Indian tax system by subsuming various indirect taxes
        such as VAT, excise duty, service tax, and more. It follows a unified
        tax structure, simplifying compliance and fostering economic growth. GST
        is categorized into Central GST (CGST), State GST (SGST), Integrated GST
        (IGST), and Union Territory GST (UTGST), each catering to specific
        transactions within the country.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Who needs to register for GST?</h3>
      <p>
        GST registration is mandatory for individuals and businesses meeting
        certain criteria. If your annual turnover exceeds the threshold set by
        the government, it is essential to register for GST. Currently, the
        threshold for GST registration is INR 40 lakhs for most states (INR 10
        lakhs for special category states). Additionally, registration is
        required for specific cases, such as inter-state businesses, e-commerce
        operators, and businesses engaged in supplying goods or services through
        online platforms.
