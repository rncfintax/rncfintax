      <h3>Understanding the GST e-Invoicing Process</h3>
      <p>
        To implement GST e-invoicing successfully, it's crucial to understand
        the step-by-step process involved:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Invoice Generation:</strong> Businesses generate e-invoices
            directly from their ERP or accounting software, adhering to the
            standardized schema specified by the GSTN (Goods and Services Tax
            Network).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Invoice Registration:</strong> The generated e-invoices are
            registered on the Invoice Registration Portal (IRP), which validates
            and digitally signs the invoices. The IRP also assigns a unique
            Invoice Reference Number (IRN) to each invoice.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>IRN Generation:</strong> The IRP generates the IRN by
            digitally signing the e-invoice along with other details such as the
            GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number) of the supplier
            and recipient, invoice number, and date.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>QR Code and Digital Signature:</strong> The IRP adds a QR
            code containing relevant invoice details and digitally signs the
            invoice using a digital signature certificate (DSC).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Sharing with Recipient:</strong> The registered e-invoice,
            along with the IRN and QR code, is shared with the recipient via
            email or any other mutually agreed mode of communication.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Generating E-Way Bills:</strong> For businesses involved in

            generating e-invoices and exchanging data effectively.
