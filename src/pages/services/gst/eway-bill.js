      <h3>What is an E-Way Bill?</h3>
      <p>
        An E-Way Bill is an electronic document required for the transportation
        of goods in India. It serves as evidence of the movement of goods and
        complies with the provisions of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.
        The E-Way Bill contains essential information about the consignment,
        such as the type of goods, their value, the supplier, the recipient, and
        the mode of transport.
