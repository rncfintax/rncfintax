        legal requirement, a registered office serves as the primary point of
        contact for government authorities, stakeholders, and clients. It acts
        as a physical representation of your business and reflects its stability
        and permanence.

          <p>
            <strong>Connectivity and Infrastructure</strong>: Ensure the chosen
            location offers excellent connectivity through road, rail, and air
            networks. Access to reliable infrastructure, such as internet
            connectivity and transportation facilities, is essential for smooth
